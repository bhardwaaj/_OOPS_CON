In normal terms Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. 
In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them.

The process of implementing encapsulation can be sub-divided into two steps:

The data members should be labeled as private using the private access specifiers
The member function which manipulates the data members should be labeled as public using the public access specifier
